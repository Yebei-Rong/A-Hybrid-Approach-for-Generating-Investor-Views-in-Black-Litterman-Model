# A Hybrid Approach for Generating Investor Views in Black Litterman Model

This is a replication of an academic paper -- A Hybrid Approach for Generating Investor Views in Black Litterman Model. This paper takes a hybrid approach to generate investor views. Specifically, it applies the ARMA-GARCH model to predict indicators for stocks and then establish a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to generate return forecasts. Finally, feeding the forecast returns into Black-Litterman (BL) model, it obtains the optimal portfolio weights for each day. Then this proposed approach is tested in a developed market, Dow Jones Index (DJI) of the US stock market.

Different from the paper we refer to, we implement this approach by using all the stocks of DJI in a time period from year 2009 to 2018 and validate our results of forecasts of year 2019. For the methodology, we follow the three well known models -- ARMA-GARCH, SVR and Black-Litterman. However, before applying the ARMA-GARCH model to stock indicators, we examined carefully of the stationary of each indicator time series. Moreover, although the paper takes the SVR and it shows that the results outperformed the DJI returns. We further analyzed other machine learning methods which are Bayesian, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, GradientBoosting. More details will be shown in the code and conclusion section.
